Agentic AI with Gemma 2
Run in Google Colab
What is Agentic AI, and how can we use it?
Most AI we encounter today is what we call "passive" or "reactive" AI. It responds to our prompts and requests. Think of asking your smart speaker to play a song or a chatbot answering your customer service questions. They’re helpful, sure, but they’re fundamentally waiting for us to tell them what to do.

Agentic AI, on the other hand, takes a fundamentally different approach. It’s all about giving AI the ability to proactively pursue goals, make decisions, and take actions in the world, even without explicit instructions every step of the way.

In this post, you will learn how to construct an Agentic AI using Gemma 2 that dynamically develops the lore of a fictional game world. This AI agent actively expands and enriches the game’s history, ensuring a distinctive and ever-changing narrative experience for every player.

Example Setup
Let’s imagine a fictional game world where AI agents craft dynamic content.

These agents, designed with specific objectives, can generate in-game content like books, poems, and songs, in response to a player choice or significant events within the game’s narrative.

A key feature of these AI agents is their ability to break down complex goals into smaller actionable steps. They can analyze different approaches, evaluate potential outcomes, and adapt their plans based on new information.

Where Agentic AI truly shines is that they’re not just passively spitting out information. They can interact with digital (and potentially physical) environments, execute tasks, and make decisions autonomously to achieve their programmed objectives.

So, how does it work?
We will use a ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) style prompt.

It defines available tools and a specific format for interaction. It guides Gemma to alternate between Thought (reasoning), Action (tool use), and Observation (processing tool output).

Below is a system prompt designed for an AI agent that generates in-game content, with the capability to use function calls to retrieve historical information.

Although Gemma 2 lacks built-in function calling capabilities, its strong instruction-following ability can be leveraged to approximate agentic behavior. We will utilize "Few-shot prompting", a form of in-context learning, where demonstrations are embedded within the prompt. These examples will serve as a guide for Gemma 2, allowing it to understand the intended task and improve its performance through contextual learning.

We received a function name (get_person_info) and parameter values ("name", "Anya, the Rebel Leader"), the game must connect to an API and call the function. We will use a synthetic response payload for this API interaction.

## The Crimson Oath

**Chapter 1: The Seed of Rebellion**

The wind howled through the crumbling stone walls of the abandoned fortress, carrying with it the scent of dust and the echoes of a forgotten war. Inside, Anya Kim, her eyes burning with a fierce resolve, paced before a flickering fire. The rebellion, a whisper at first, had grown into a roaring flame, fueled by the desperation of the people. 

Eldoria, once a beacon of prosperity, now lay shrouded in a suffocating darkness. The royal court, a gilded cage of privilege, had turned a blind eye to the suffering of the common folk. Taxes soared, the land withered under the weight of the crown's greed, and the whispers of discontent grew louder with each passing day.

Anya, a woman forged in the fires of injustice, had seen enough. The crimson oath, a symbol of defiance, burned brightly in her heart. It was a promise to her people, a vow to fight for their freedom, to reclaim their stolen dignity.

"We are the forgotten," she declared, her voice echoing through the cavernous hall, "the shadows of a kingdom that forgets its own people."

Her words resonated with the gathered rebels, their faces etched with a mixture of fear and hope. They were farmers, artisans, merchants, and laborers, united by a common thread of suffering and a yearning for a better tomorrow.

Anya, the Desert Flame, had ignited a spark of rebellion, a flicker of hope in the face of despair. The Crimson Oath, a symbol of their defiance, was a testament to their unwavering resolve. The fight for Eldoria's freedom had begun.
